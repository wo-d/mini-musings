## Hello!

Welcome to the inaugural post on Mini Musings! You're probably one of, if we're being optimistic, dozens of humans who are reading this. The blog serves as a central place for me to collect my thoughts, show off a bit, and keep an ever expanding record of what goes on in my hobby sphere.

## The Hobby Space
I'd be lying if I said Warhammer has been an ever present force in my life, something which I was enamored with as a child. To be honest I knew of Warhammer 40k (less so of fantasy) in so far as it was a game played with miniatures where everything was measured with rulers, and there were a bunch of video games spawned off the IP. It wasn't until around February 2020 when a friend mentioned the game Kill Team, and if I was interested in playing. Well it's pretty obvious what happened next, I said yes and picked up my first box of Warhammer, 10 Kabalite Warriors.

### Everything Starts Somewhere

In the beginning I was simply using a cheap LED desk lamp and a coffee table in my living room to paint up some Kabalite Warriors. Look at these guys, a regular paint by numbers. I still have these guys, and they regularly feature in my Drukhari army.

### Desk Life

I moved on from the coffee table pretty quickly as shortly after painting my first Kill Team I moved in to my partner's condo. Here there was a worktable where they and I would paint side by side. You can make out the two lamps, each one over our respective tiny painting spaces. We watched a lot of Star Trek there, Next Gen of course. _Engage_
